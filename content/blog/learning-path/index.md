<!-- Hello everyone,

as anticipated in the presentation article of this blog, I'm going to transparently show what my current studies are about. In particular, I'll post a link reconducting to my Notion personal page, where there is the list of courses I took or I'm taking, with a brief description and some additional details.

At the moment I'm writing (January 2024), my focus is on two topics:
- to learn **Scala** programing language;
- to learn **Spark** Framework. By saying this, I am not referring to "learn DataFrame API", which is what many people intend when they say "I'm learning Spark", but it would be a really comprehensive knowledge on this big framework. I'll go more in depth on that very shortly.

Now, I want to share the motivations that push me to mainly focus on these two topics.

As far as concerned to **Spark**, the motivations are pretty trivial. Knowing Spark is a must for every Data Engineers. It's a prerequisite for everyone wants to try to enter in the Data domain. The fact is that, as far as I understood, many people just learn the surface of Spark, meaning that as far as they become familiar with this tool (in particular with DataFrame API) they think they know Spark. The pradadox is that most probably kwnowing DataFrame API is enough for the 90% of applications. But, as someone who aspires to be a Data Enginner, I cannot afford to kwnow Spark only superficially. I am very aware that Data Engineering is not only about Spark, but it's a good starting point in my opinion.

About Scala, motivations are slighlty different. Scala is a very niche programming language and maybe learning that could not be the best investement right now for me. But, I choose to invest my time learning that for two main reasons:
- I happened to find a good Scala teacher who has the ability to transmit me his big passion for Scala. His way to exaplain is brillian. He's Daniel Ciocîrlan, a Software Engineer who creates a great learning platform called [RockTheJvm](https://rockthejvm.com/), where he constantly posts articles about JVM languages and has paid course on some JVM topics, but mainly on Scala and related topics (Spark, Akka, Zio and Cats, Flink, and so on). Indeed the courses I am currently taking are from this platform;
- basically I like it;
- having an additional tool in your toolbox is not bad;
- learning Scala is not only about syntax; it's about a new way of thinking programming software. Scala is great (and mostly knonw) in Functional Programming, which is an alternative way of writing software to Objective-Oriented Programming. Again, having Functional Porgramming paradigm in your toolbox is not bad.

Learning Scala will not be easy. It's widely regarded as a very difficult programming language to learn, with a steep learning curve. For my personal case, the difficulty is increased by the fact that I have not the opportunity to use Scala at work, so I can use that only in my free time, which is msot probabily not enough. But for the moment my intentions to learn it reamains. -->

Hello everyone,

As mentioned in the introductory article of this blog, I'm here to transparently share details about my current studies.

At the moment of writing (January 2024), my focus is on two main topics:

- **Learning Scala Programming Language**;
- **Mastering the Spark Framework**. I want to clarify that when I mention learning Spark, I'm not referring to just understanding the DataFrame API, as many often do when they say they're learning Spark. My goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of this extensive framework.

Now, let me share the motivations driving my focus on these two subjects.

Regarding Spark, the motivations are fairly straightforward. Knowing Spark is crucial for any Data Engineer. It serves as a prerequisite for those venturing into the data domain. However, I've noticed that many people only scratch the surface of Spark, particularly with the DataFrame API, and believe they've mastered it. The paradox is that knowing the DataFrame API might suffice for about 90% of applications. Still, aspiring to be a thorough Data Engineer, I cannot settle for a superficial understanding of Spark. While I acknowledge that Data Engineering involves more than just Spark, it's a solid starting point in my opinion.

As for Scala, the motivations are slightly different. Scala is a niche programming language, and investing time in it might not be the most lucrative option for me right now. However, I've chosen to dedicate time to it for a couple of reasons:
- I found an excellent Scala teacher, Daniel Ciocîrlan, a Software Engineer behind [RockTheJvm](https://rockthejvm.com/), a learning platform where he writes articles on JVM languages and offers paid courses on various JVM topics, predominantly Scala and related subjects (Spark, Akka, Zio, Cats, Flink, etc.). The courses I'm currently taking are from this platform. He's just brilliant and clear in his explaination and he was able to transmit me his great passion for Scala.
- I genuinely enjoy working with Scala.
- Having an additional tool in my toolbox is always beneficial.
- Learning Scala isn't just about memorizing its syntax; it's about adapting to a new way of approaching software development. Scala stands out, widely known for its effectiveness in Functional Programming, which offers an alternative to the traditional Object-Oriented Programming. Having Functional Programming in your skill set isn't a disadvantage; it's a practical advantage.

Learning Scala is a bit tough, to be honest. They say it's not the easiest language, and I agree—it's a bit challenging. Also, I don't use Scala at work, so I only practice in my free time, which isn't a whole lot and most probably it's likely insufficient. But, you know what, I'm still sticking to my plan of learning it, at least for now.

In two of the next blog posts (not necessarily the next two), I'm gonna dive into what I'm picking up about Scala and Spark and I'll also try to share what's inside the courses.
