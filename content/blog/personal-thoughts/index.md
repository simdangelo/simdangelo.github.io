I actually feel unsatisfied and have the impression that I am wasting my time, or at least not using it in the right way. I am constantly focused on my professional growth, but perhaps too much with the mind and too little with facts. This is not really true because I'm studying a lot, but perhaps in the wrong way or the wrong things.

A year (plus six month of intern) has passed since I started working, and I feel like in all this time I could have done more. I am not mastering any programming language or any tech framework and this makes me feel bad. A year and a half is not a lot, but it's not little either.

Maybe it's only a bad period.
