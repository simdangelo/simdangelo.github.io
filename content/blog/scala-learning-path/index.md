As mentioned in one of the previous blost posts, I'm going to dive into the learning study about **Scala** programming language I am currently following (when time permits).

The Scala course I am following comes from the platform built by Daniel Ciocîrlan ([here's the link](https://rockthejvm.com/p/scala)) and it is about the fundamentals of Scala and Functional Programming.

My intention for the future is to provide insights into these topics without delving into details, focusing instead on highlighting the most basic but crucial aspects to understand.

1. The Absolute Basics
    * Values and Types
    * Expressions
    * Functions
    * Type Inference
    * Recursion
    * Call by Name and Call by Value
    * Default and Named Arguments
    * String Operations and Interpolations
2. Object-Oriented Programming in Scala
    * Object-Oriented Basics
    * Object-Oriented Basics: Exercises
    * Method Notation
    * Inheritance
    * Access Modifiers
    * Preventing Inheritance
    * Scala Objects
    * Abstract Classes and Traits
    * Object-Oriented Exercise: A Linked List
    * Generics
    * Anonymous Classes
    * Exercise: Extending MyList
    * Case Classes
    * Enums
    * Handling Exceptions
    * Import and Exports
3. Functional Programming in Scala
    * What’s a Function, really?
    * Anonymous Functions
    * Higher-Order Functions and Currying
    * HOFs & Currying: Exercises
    * HOFs & Currying: Exercises (part 2)
    * Map, flatMap, filter and for-comprehension
    * Linear Collections: Seq, List, Vector, Array, Set, Range
    * Tuples and Maps
    * Tuples and Maps: Exercises
    * Handling Absence: Option
    * Handling Failure: Try
4. Scala Power
    * Pattern matching
    * ALL the Patterns!
    * Patterns Everywhere
